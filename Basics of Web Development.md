The communication happens between the two partners **Server** and **Client**. There are [three different types of communication](https://medium.com/@subhangdxt/beginners-guide-to-client-server-communication-8099cf0ac3af) they would have together:
- **Requests**: Requests are sent from the client in order to ask the server for some data like files, or tell the server about things that happen, like that a user wants to login with his credentials
- **Response**: A response is sent from the server to the client and is the reaction of the server to a request of the client. This could for example be an authentication result.
- **Service**: A Service is a specific task that the server provides for the client to use, like downloading image
